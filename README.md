my favourite languages atm: rust / typescript

i have:

- expertise in:
  - serverside/backend development
  - frontend development (VGUI in C++, web development in Typescript)

- been looking to study/program:
  - game development/graphics rendering
  - embedded systems programming

- familiarity with (ordered from most to least experienced):
  - Lua
    - so nice to use as a scripting language
    - <3
  - C/C++
    - I don't like unsafe by default
    - </3
  - Javascript
    - i CAN, but the typesafety provided by TS is usually non negotiable
    - </3
  - Swift
    - like if Rust had classes, for whenever inheritance is important
    - <3
  - Haxe
    - recently picked this up! I like its syntax
    - <3
